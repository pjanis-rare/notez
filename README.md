# notez
## Revolutionary novel key-agnostic musical system

Properties:
- All notes and scales are equally cumbersome to notate
- The 12 notez are `ki, ko, ku, li, lo, lu, vi, vo, vu, mi, mo, mu` with middle `ko` being 440 Hz
- E.g. traditional medieval C-alt scale begins `C Db D# E`, while F#-alt is `F# G G## A#` or `F# G A A#`
- In notez, the same scales would be `lo-lu-vo-vu` and `mu-ki-ku-li`. No ambiguity, no half-step modifiers!

On the notez:
- The names of the notez don't contain any same letters as the traditional medieval system.
- The consonants and vowels are pronounced progressively from back of the mouth to front of the mouth: `k,l,v,m`, `i,o,u`
- Minor third intervals keep the vowel unchanged. Major third cyclically increments the vowel by one.
- Each note has its own distinctive RGB color, and the colors are cyclic over the 12-note octave.
- Color change of a half-step is perceptually equal length (TBD: perceptually uniform cyclic color scheme for the color blind).
